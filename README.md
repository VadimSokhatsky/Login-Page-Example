# Login-Page-Example

This is an example of login page in 'my-project' app.

On the first lines of Login.tsx we can see imports from our custom NPM repositories.

It was created because 'my-project' app has 2 versions - Residential and Commercial, which are little different in UI, but use a lot of common logic.

On this page we are using custom hooks like useForm and useValidation to handle comfortably user input data.
